        <h2>Self-Employed: Sales Automation in a Dropshipping Model</h2>
        
        <h3>Business Model and Scale of Operation</h3>
        <p>
            The project's goal was to create a scalable business model based on statistics and the law of large numbers. After gaining access to product feeds from several dozen wholesalers, I managed a catalog of hundreds of thousands of products. The strategy involved bulk listing tens of thousands of offers on sales platforms to maximize exposure and sales.
        </p>

        <h3>The Problem and the Need for Custom Tools</h3>
        <p>
            Standard SaaS software (e.g., BaseLinker) and the official APIs of sales platforms (e.g., OLX) proved insufficient for handling such a large scale of operations and the specific needs of the business model. This necessitated the creation of my own dedicated solutions to automate key processes.
        </p>

        <h3>Custom Tools and Automations</h3>
        
        <h4>1. Automated Product Listing System</h4>
        <p>
            I created software in Python that automated the process of adding products to the OLX platform. A key feature was its handling of the unique "Pay if you sell" model, which allowed for large-scale operations with minimal financial investment.
        </p>

        <h4>2. AI-Powered Product Categorizer</h4>
        <p>
            In response to the strict categorization requirements for bulk listing, I built a custom categorization system. The tool utilized the OpenAI API to perform multiple verification steps and assign categories, achieving a <b>95% accuracy rate</b> compared to the platform's own categorizer, which was about 60% accurate. This project is available as a separate repository on my GitHub.
        </p>
        
        <h4>3. Product Page "Factory" with Payment Integration</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Designed a Python script that mass-generates static product pages from CSV data using Jinja2 templates.</li>
            <li>Implemented automatic integration with the Stripe API to dynamically create products, price lists, and unique payment links for each page.</li>
            <li>Created an automated deployment process (CI/CD) where the script, after generating the pages, publishes them online using Git commands.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Project Outcome</h3>
        <p>
            The developed tools successfully automated key aspects of the business and confirmed the effectiveness of the chosen strategy. However, further scaling of the project was halted by the technical limitations of the external sales platform, which was not designed to handle accounts of such a large scale. The project provided valuable insights into the limitations of SaaS platforms and confirmed the effectiveness of custom automation tools.
        </p>
