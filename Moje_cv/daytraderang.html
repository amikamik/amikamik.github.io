        <h1>Experience: Financial Markets Analyst / Proprietary Trader</h1>
        <h2>Akademia Day Tradingu (Partner of Canadian Proptrading Firm Title Trading), Gliwice</h2>
        
        <p>
            My journey into professional trading was born from a deep passion for statistics and intellectual curiosity. I wanted to practically test the academic efficient-market hypothesis—to see if, in the real world, armed with the right tools and analytical thinking, one could find and exploit market anomalies.
        </p>
        <p>
            The beginning of this path was an intensive, six-month onboarding program that was a true test of skill and discipline. Its goal was not to teach ready-made strategies, but to encourage independent conclusions through observation and analysis of order book dynamics (Level 2). The condition for completion was to achieve and maintain a specific profitability threshold, which forced rapid learning and adaptation. This experience gave me unique, in-depth knowledge of market microstructure—where inefficiencies truly originate and what signals to look for in the seemingly chaotic flow of orders.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my daily practice, I specialized in short-term strategies on European markets, primarily the London Stock Exchange (LSE). I focused on less liquid stocks, where specific, short-lived inefficiencies often appeared, especially during mergers and acquisitions (M&A). My role often resembled that of a market maker—by actively placing buy and sell orders, I provided liquidity for less popular securities while capitalizing on price dynamics anomalies.
        </p>
        <p>
            This experience allowed me to feel the market firsthand and transform theoretical statistical concepts into real investment strategies. I understood the critical importance of a disciplined, analytical approach and how, step by step, one can build a statistical edge that, in the long run, allows for outperforming the market. It was an invaluable lesson in the practical implementation of quantitative thinking in one of the most competitive environments in the world.
