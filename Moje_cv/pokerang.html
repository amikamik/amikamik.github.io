        <h1>Experience: Online Poker Player / Strategy Analyst</h1>
        <h2>Self-Employed (2015 – 2018)</h2>
        
        <h3>Context and Motivation</h3>
        <p>
            During my studies, online poker became not only a source of income for me but, above all, a practical laboratory for testing statistical concepts in a real competitive environment. It was an invaluable lesson that allowed me to see how effective statistical methods and the law of large numbers are in a high-variance environment, where a disciplined, analytical approach is key.
        </p>

        <h3>Analytical Approach and Scale of Operation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Large Sample Analysis:</b> My gameplay and strategies were tested on an analytical sample of millions of hands, which allowed for the systematic achievement of a positive expected value (EV+).</li>
            <li><b>Real-Time Information Processing:</b> Regularly playing on over a dozen tables simultaneously forced the development of skills for quickly processing large amounts of data (opponent statistics, game dynamics) and making optimal decisions under time pressure.</li>
            <li><b>Practical Application of Theory:</b> This experience involved the continuous application of statistics, game theory, and psychology to build an edge over opponents.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Results and Evidence</h3>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, most of the poker platforms where I achieved my best results (e.g., Full Tilt Poker) no longer exist. Below, I have attached publicly available statistics from my account on the PokerStars platform, recorded by the independent service SharkScope.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>What does the graph show?</b> It presents the profit curve as a function of tournaments played. The visible, systematic growth (despite natural fluctuations, known as variance) is evidence of a statistical advantage over the average player (the "edge") and confirms the effectiveness of an analytical approach in the long term.
